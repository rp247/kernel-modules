What is a kernel module?
- Code that can be loaded and unloaded from kernel.
- Wont have to build or reboot the kernel for a minor change (not monolithic)

Use case:
- File systems (loading and unloading on demand)
- Device drivers (for plug and play)

How does it get loaded?
- Kernels calls kmod daemon which execcutes modprobe to load a module
- modprobe is passed either module name as a string or a identifier (looks in /etc/modprobe.conf)
- next it looks for dependencies in /lib/modules/kernel_version/modules.dep
